# Planning

* well this may be super helpful: https://carpentries.org/assessment/
* I like the idea of using some of the items from their pre-survey - it would allow us to compare our impact to theirs: https://carpentries.github.io/assessment-archives/pre-workshop/pre-workshop.html
* I think this is the conversation we want to be part of - this is a response to a paper by david feldon, who is at Utah State (and who interviewed at MSU a few years ago): https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/response-null-effects.html
* relevant to interpreting carpentries surveys: https://zenodo.org/record/1325464#.Xu87hBNKiCO
* long-term survey we can consider adopting: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=LksuekfCD3hzLW6lPkx9qhkRF5nDt8uGWpN7lq2Mx0Dqw1Zriv3qYFpu3XtR46ei (for like a "delayed" post-survey)
* one more idea for framing the potential write-up - the question the carpentries folks raise about the feldon work is that whether a workshop works is often an uninteresting question relative to the question of under what conditions one might work: https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/response-null-effects.html. matt was actually sort of tangentially involved in a similar debate at one point: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022487113511497?casa_token=2m32ve1ZjGgAAAAA:_lwoZcLZ7frYc99pifiOOz2OwYO8luavq8VJVGkAnDSV5VN7h5gxVR0UQ5-FFMC5Kh9FouQoJXGeAg (I think a study matt was involved in was cited prominently in this debate)
* last thing, I don't have bandwidth and think y you likely don't now, either, but the carpentries have never actually published their findings in a journal, or presented at a conference; and all the data is here, and they invite folks to work with it: https://github.com/carpentries/assessment
